# Fifa-Price-arbitrage
I used a futbin r package to scrape data regarding the prices of fifa cards. I then found the biggest changes to identify any potential incorrect readings on futbins website which would result in people miss-listing their cards. this was my introduction to programming as i self taught myself to use these technologies with no prior experience. I was able to create a chron schedule that would upload the scraped data to a google sheets where pivot tables identified the largest price drops. 

the google sheets are accessible here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g-0HmEzmLpgDivQ9CR3i8Vv1BJs4DGMEXS_iVTD_VTk/edit#gid=1726214718 and https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HFIwpMJJbAVI_TVfYUkrCX56fx_Opb--MVYMnirGzvk/edit#gid=1892502693.
